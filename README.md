## Hi there 👋

Developer, with knowledge about ecology & geoinformatics

- 🔭 I’m currently working on [ndff](https://ndff.nl/) (backend, infra (both on-premise and cloud), postgresql with postgis. The language I use is python)
- 🏺 Previously PHP developer, but within the domain (data, infra, geo) I like the work, it is not the best match.
- 🌱 I’m currently improving on cloud technologies (k8, iac with pulumi)  
- 💬 Ask me about geoinformation, python, cloud, linux, docker, and typescript.
